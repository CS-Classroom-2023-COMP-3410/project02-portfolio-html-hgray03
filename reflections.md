This assignment was very interesting, especially using chatGPT, because of it's simplicity. often when prompt engineering for this assignment, even if I specified not to use CSS, chat would use it anyway. It was a great refresher for simple html syntax, because I had to edit some minor things to get it to look exactly how I wanted. Overall, I think this assignment was beneficial, and that I got good review of what I already knew, and learned some new things from it. As previously mentioned, the biggest problem I faced was limiting the ability of chatGPT.
